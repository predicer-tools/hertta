# hertta

**Still in development and not ready for use.**

Hertta is designed to be used with the open-source home automation system Home Assistant, where it can be used in add-on form. Hertta optimizes the operation of home heating devices.

In the future Hertta will be also a user interface for using Predicer in predicer-tools. Predicer is a ‘Predictive decider’ for actors making decisions over multiple stages.
